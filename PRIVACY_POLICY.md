## DisplayInfo: Privacy policy

Welcome to the DisplayInfo app!

This is an open source Android app. The source code is available on GitHub under the MIT license; the app is also available on Google Play.

As an avid Android user myself, I take privacy very seriously.
I know how irritating it is when apps collect your data without your knowledge.
 
This app only shows your device's display information and doesn't collect any kind of data.
